# AutoProp Integration Plan for BuildwiseAI

## Overview

3. Evaluate data format and integration complexity
4. Negotiate licensing and partnership terms

### Phase 2: Proof of Concept
```typescript
// AutoProp API Integration Service
export class AutoPropService {
  private apiKey: string;
  private baseUrl = 'https://api.autoprop.ca'; // TBD
  
  async getPropertyData(address: string, city: string) {
    // Integration with AutoProp API
    const response = await fetch(`${this.baseUrl}/property/search`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${this.apiKey}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ address, city })
    });
    
    return response.json();
  }
  
  async getMunicipalData(pid: string) {
    // Get zoning, permits, development applications
    const response = await fetch(`${this.baseUrl}/municipal/${pid}`);
    return response.json();
  }
}
```

### Phase 3: Full Integration
