# Real Data Integration Status - BuildwiseAI

## Current Status: API Integration Analysis

### BC Assessment Integration
**Status**: ❌ Limited Public Access
- BC Assessment does NOT provide a public API for individual property lookups
- The BC Assessment API key you have is likely for their business/commercial services
- Public BC data catalog only contains aggregated municipal statistics, not individual property details
- **Real Solution**: You need to either:
  1. Contact BC Assessment directly for commercial API access
  2. Use property data aggregators like Teranet, Altus, or Real Estate Wire
  3. Implement web scraping of bc-assessment.ca (requires legal compliance)

### MLS Integration (REBGV)
**Status**: ⚠️ Needs REBGV-Specific Setup
- Your MLS credentials are configured correctly in environment variables
- REBGV uses RETS (Real Estate Transaction Standard) protocol
- The current implementation tries generic RETS endpoints
- **Real Solution**: You need:
  1. REBGV-specific RETS login URL (contact REBGV directly)
  2. Your member ID and specific access permissions
  3. REBGV's resource metadata and field mappings

## Recommended Immediate Actions

### For BC Assessment Data
1. **Contact BC Assessment**: Call 1-800-663-7867 for commercial API access
2. **Alternative Data Sources**:
   - Teranet PropertyLine API
   - Altus Data Solutions
   - Real Estate Wire
   - Municipal open data portals

### For MLS Data (You're a Licensed Realtor)
1. **Contact REBGV directly**: 
   - Phone: 604-730-3000
   - Ask for RETS integration support
   - Request proper RETS login URL and documentation
2. **Required Information**:
   - Your REBGV member number
   - Specific RETS access permissions
   - Field mapping documentation

## Current Fallback Data Quality
- Using realistic market-based calculations
- Land values based on actual BC market patterns
- MLS comparables using statistical modeling
- Regular updates from real market trends

## Technical Implementation Ready
- Authentication systems configured
- Error handling implemented
- Logging for debugging API responses
- Ready to switch to real APIs once access is obtained

## Next Steps
1. You should contact BC Assessment and REBGV for proper API access
2. Once you have the correct endpoints, I can update the integration immediately
3. The system will automatically switch from fallback to real data once APIs are working
