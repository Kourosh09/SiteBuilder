# Real Data Integration Status - BuildwiseAI

## Current Status: API Integration Analysis

### BC Assessment Integration
**Status**: ❌ Limited Public Access
- BC Assessment does NOT provide a public API for individual property lookups
- The BC Assessment API key you have is likely for their business/commercial services
- Public BC data catalog only contains aggregated municipal statistics, not individual property details
- **Real Solution**: You need to either:
  1. Contact BC Assessment directly for commercial API access
  2. Use property data aggregators like Teranet, Altus, or Real Estate Wire
  3. Implement web scraping of bc-assessment.ca (requires legal compliance)

### MLS Integration via REALTOR.ca DDF
**Status**: ✅ Official Path Identified - REALTOR.ca Data Distribution Facility
- **Official Registration**: https://ddf.realtor.ca/Distribution/Destinations/RegisterDestination.aspx
- REALTOR.ca DDF is the authorized way to access Canadian MLS data
- Provides standardized API access to all provincial MLS systems
- **Your Access**: As a licensed realtor, you're eligible to register
- **Real Solution**: Complete DDF registration process:
  1. Register your application at the DDF portal
  2. Get approved for data access permissions
  3. Receive official API credentials and endpoints
  4. Implement using DDF's standardized data format

## Recommended Immediate Actions

## Current Fallback Data Quality

## Technical Implementation Ready

2. Once you have the correct endpoints, I can update the integration immediately
3. The system will automatically switch from fallback to real data once APIs are working
