# Simple Framer Setup - No Tech Skills Needed

## Skip Framer for Now - Use This Instead

Since Framer is confusing, let's focus on what's working perfectly:

### Your Current Setup (Already Working)
✅ **Marketing Homepage**: `https://buildwiseai-comprehensive-platform.replit.app/`
✅ **Functional Dashboard**: `https://buildwiseai-comprehensive-platform.replit.app/dashboard`
✅ **All Tools Working**: AI analysis, Bill 44 checker, real Vancouver permits
✅ **Professional Design**: Looks great, works perfectly

## Option 1: Keep It Simple (Recommended)
**Just use your current Replit site for everything:**
- Homepage has all marketing content
- Dashboard has all working tools
- No need for Framer complexity
- Ready to deploy to your domain `buildwiseai.ca`

## Option 2: Easy Framer Setup (If You Want To Try)
### Just 3 Simple Steps:

1. **Open Framer Project**
   - Go to: https://framer.com/projects/Website--9ApMcAmqBm7a9kFS33AI-hqII8
   - Log in with your account

2. **Find the Main Button**
   - Look for "Get Started" or "Try Now" button
   - Click on it to select it

3. **Change the Link**
   - On the right side, find "Link" section
   - Replace whatever URL is there with:
   ```
   https://buildwiseai-comprehensive-platform.replit.app/dashboard
   ```
   - Save the project

That's it! Your Framer site will now send visitors to your working dashboard.

## My Recommendation
**Don't worry about Framer right now.** Your current platform is:
- Professional looking
- Fully functional 
- Ready for real users
- Easy to deploy to your domain

Focus on:
1. Deploy to `buildwiseai.ca` domain
2. Start using the platform for real work
3. Add Framer later when you have time

Your BuildwiseAI platform is already complete and impressive!
