Great memory — yes, we did discuss integrating MLS data and BC Assessment data for BuildwiseAI to support land valuation, feasibility analysis, and lead generation.

Here’s a summary of where that fits in and what we planned:

🔍 BuildwiseAI: MLS & BC Assessment Integration Plan
✅ Purpose
Gather real estate property data to:

Identify undervalued or off-market land

Analyze development potential (e.g., zoning, lot size, assessed value)

Pre-fill financial feasibility tools

Enhance lead scoring for JV opportunities

📌 1. BC Assessment (Public API or Scraping)
Data to collect:

Land + Improvement Value

Lot size / Zoning

Property Type (Single family, duplex, etc.)

Year Built, Building Area

Legal Description

Roll Number / PID

How to get it:

BC Assessment doesn’t provide a free API, but their public property search can be scraped (within legal boundaries).

Alternatively, some 3rd-party providers (e.g., DataBC) offer open GIS or parcel data.

📌 2. MLS Data
Used for:

Recent sales comps

Current listings

Market trends (price per sq ft, DOM)

Options:

RETS feed or Web API (only available via licensed realtors)

Partner with a realtor who can provide access to listings data

Use Roomvu-like automation via public-facing MLS search (scraping results pages by area)

Alternatively, try integrating with platforms like:

RealtyServer

CREA DDF® (via a real estate brokerage)

🧠 Planned Workflow (How it fits in BuildwiseAI)
User inputs a property address or PID

System auto-pulls BC Assessment info

System searches MLS or past sales for comps

Output:

Estimated value range

Density potential based on zoning

Recommended development type (e.g., 4-plex, 6-plex)

ROI projections (from valuation module)

✅ Next Step
Would you like to:

Add a placeholder section in the UI for “Property Lookup” now?

Integrate a sample CSV or dummy API fetch to simulate this?

Build a form in your Replit app to collect address/PID and return mock results?

Let me know how deep you want to go today — and I’ll walk you through adding it to the site or app.
