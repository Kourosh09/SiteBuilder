Perfect — here’s how we planned the lead generation and social media automation module for BuildwiseAI, inspired by Roomvu and similar platforms:

🚀 BuildwiseAI Lead Generation & Social Media Automation
🧱 Core Features (as discussed):
✅ 1. Automated Lead Capture for Builders & Realtors
Landing pages tailored to different real estate niches (e.g., landowners, developers, investors)

Embedded contact forms that auto-capture:

Name

Property address (for JV)

Project interest (sell, JV, finance)

Email / phone

CRM-style backend to track inquiries and tag hot leads

✅ Already started: We have the basic form layout in HTML — we can expand this to save submissions in Replit or via Google Sheets/Airtable.

✅ 2. Social Media Content Automation (Roomvu-style)
Pre-written real estate posts for:

Builder tips

Market insights

Investment advice

Local development projects

Ability to auto-schedule or copy-paste for:

Instagram

Facebook

LinkedIn

Eventually add AI caption generation using GPT-4 via OpenAI API.

✅ 3. Landing Page Generator
Realtor or builder enters:

Their name, headshot, logo, contact info

AI builds a personalized one-page site with:

“Get a free valuation”

“Partner with us”

Testimonials

Embedded forms + analytics tracking

✅ 4. Facebook/Instagram Ad Copy Generator
Simple form:

Target audience

Offer or property

AI generates:

Headline

Body copy

Call-to-action

Hashtags

🧪 MVP Plan
We can build this in 2 stages:

🥇 Phase 1 (Now)
Simple lead capture form

AI-powered ad copy generator (via OpenAI)

Manual social media post templates

Save leads to a CSV or display in Replit app

🥈 Phase 2 (Later)
Social post scheduler

AI image integration (via DALL·E or Canva)

Landing page builder

CRM dashboard

🔧 Next Steps
Would you like me to:

Add a “Get Leads” tab/page to your site now?

Build a Lead Generator Form and hook it to a CSV or email?

Add the AI Ad Copy Generator using OpenAI API (you already started this)?

Let me know where you'd like to begin, and I’ll walk you through or write the code for it now.

also reciving the zoing update and potential construction design fro how about connecting to cities date like AUTOPROP

Excellent — you're thinking strategically.

Here's how we can structure this Zoning Intelligence & Site Design Automation module — and how platforms like AUTOPROP fit in:

🏗️ BuildwiseAI – Zoning + City Data Integration (Inspired by AUTOPROP)
🎯 Purpose:
Automate zoning lookups, design possibilities, and development potential

Provide builders and realtors with “What can I build here?” answers instantly

✅ 1. Connect to Municipal Zoning Data (City APIs / GIS Layers)
Cities like Vancouver, Surrey, and others publish zoning maps and bylaws in:

Open Data portals (GeoJSON, shapefiles, REST APIs)

Direct GIS map layers

PDF zoning bylaw tables (for parsing)

We can:

Pull zoning code based on address/PID

Match it to a table of “permitted uses” and “maximum density/FAR”

Return development potential: e.g., duplex, 6-plex, stacked townhomes

👉 Implementation Plan:

Use GeoAPI or ArcGIS REST API to query by coordinates

Store and match zoning code to allowed density/forms

Create a zoning_rules.json file as fallback for MVP

✅ 2. Feasibility Rules + Suggested Design
Once zoning is known, use AI logic to suggest:

Max # of units (based on lot size + FAR)

Possible unit mix (e.g., 2 x 3-bed, 2 x 2-bed)

Suggested design layout (e.g., side-by-side, stacked, row homes)

Eventually:

Add AI-generated sketches (via DALL·E or integrations)

Enable export of design brief (PDF or CAD handoff)

✅ 3. AUTOPROP-Like Workflow
AUTOPROP aggregates:

BC Assessment

Zoning

ALR/Floodplain overlays

Transit proximity

Site dimensions

Past transactions

🔧 For BuildwiseAI:

We mimic this with:

BC Assessment data (as discussed earlier)

GIS zoning layers

Custom overlays (CSV or API-fed)

Development calculator (Python module)

Feasibility AI report

✅ 4. Future Options
Partner with AUTOPROP or Landcor (licensed access)

Add APIs like:

City of Vancouver Open Data

DataBC

ArcGIS REST

✅ MVP ACTION ITEMS
Would you like to:

Add a Zoning Lookup Tool to your MVP (manual lookup or auto via GIS API)?

Build a feasibility logic module based on zoning, lot size, and design logic?

Integrate a PDF zoning summary report generator (for sharing)?

I can start coding any of these today inside your Replit environment. Let me know your preferred priority!
