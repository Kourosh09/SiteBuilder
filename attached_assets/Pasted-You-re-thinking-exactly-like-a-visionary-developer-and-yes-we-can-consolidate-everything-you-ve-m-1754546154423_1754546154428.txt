You're thinking exactly like a visionary developer — and yes, we can consolidate everything you've mentioned into the BuildwiseAI platform within your Replit environment. Here's how we’ll proceed:

✅ Consolidated BuildwiseAI Roadmap (Based on Our Full Discussion)
🔹 Core Modules Already Discussed & To Be Added
Module	Description	Status
🔍 Lead Generation Tool	Roomvu-style social media post automation + lead capture	Started – ready to expand
📈 Land Feasibility Analyzer	Input property, analyze zoning, suggest unit mix and density	Discussed – needs logic module
🗂️ Property Data Integration	Pull from BC Assessment + MLS data (manually or via API)	Planned – data structure ready
🏗️ Zoning & Development Potential	Show what can be built, based on zoning rules	In design – zoning_rules.json coming
🧠 AI-Powered Ad/Email Generator	For social ads, JV outreach, and investor proposals	In progress – OpenAI key required
📄 JV Deal Flow Tracker	Basic CRM-style lead/partner tracking system	Starting soon – CSV or Google Sheets
🏘️ Design Generator (AI)	Uses AI to suggest basic layouts/sketches (via DALL·E)	Future phase
🧭 Permit Tracker (BuildMapper-style)	Discover nearby construction projects & their permit stage	NEW – see below
🤝 Trade/Consultant Engagement	Let trades/architects pitch proposals to developers	NEW – see below

🆕 BuildMapper-Inspired Features to Add
🧱 1. Permit & Nearby Development Tracking
Use open city permit databases (some cities publish active permits)

Show map view or list of:

Type of construction

Stage (application, under review, approved)

Architect or builder info (if available)

✅ Implementation plan:

Start with static JSON sample permit data

Later connect to:

City of Vancouver Development & Building Permits

BC Data Catalogue

🤝 2. Trade & Consultant Proposal System
Builders/owners post project opportunities (with scope + location)

Architects, engineers, trades can submit:

Proposal

Portfolio links

Contact info

✅ MVP Idea:

Create a “Find Partners” form + database of proposals

Optionally: email notification to builder on new submissions

🧠 3. Architect AI / Sketch Generator
Use DALL·E or Sketch-R (AI model for floor plans)

Input: zoning code, unit count, design intent

Output: simple floorplan sketch or concept image

✅ For now:

Accept user input (lot size, zoning, etc.)

Use prompt + OpenAI API to generate an image using DALL·E

🔧 NEXT STEPS
✅ I’ll add the following components to Replit:

Sidebar navigation for:

Lead Gen

Zoning Analyzer

Permit Lookup

Find Partners

AI Design Generator

Each page will include:

HTML UI

Python/Flask logic

Placeholder logic for data/API connection

✅ I’ll summarize all OpenAI API integrations and tell you where to plug in your key.

✅ I’ll enable saving to CSV or Google Sheets for lead tracking & proposals.

Would you like the Permit Tracker + Find Partners modules added first now?
Or prioritize AI-powered design generation?

Once confirmed, I’ll begin directly updating your Replit project.

Yes. Don't to forget in our cities. Maple Ridge, Burnaby, Tricities, mission, lably and offcourse lower mnainanad in fi possible whaole bc an dthrouout canada .....usa aas we go forward

Perfect — I’ve noted the target cities for initial launch:

✅ Initial Coverage Focus:

Maple Ridge

Burnaby

Tricities (Coquitlam, Port Coquitlam, Port Moody)

Mission

Langley

Lower Mainland

🛠️ Planned Expansion:

All of BC

Across Canada

Into the USA as data access grows

📌 Next Step: I’ll start wiring this geographic scope into:

The zoning analyzer (per city)

The permit tracker sample data

The trade/consultant engagement module

Let’s get the MVP live with this scope — and scale step by step from there.

Would you like to start with:

Permit Tracker (local permit feed prototype)

or AI Floorplan Generator (DALL·E integration)?

I'll continue from there.

Great — I'll proceed with:

✅ Phase 1 Implementation for BuildwiseAI (MVP Expansion)
1. Permit Tracker Prototype (BuildMapper-style)
Mock feed of active permits (starting with Maple Ridge & Burnaby)

Fields: Address, Permit Type, Status, Builder, Architect

Search & filter by city and permit stage

2. "Find Partners" Module
Form for trade professionals to submit proposals (name, trade, location, project interest)

Developer-side dashboard to view and manage submissions

3. AI Floorplan Generator (Early Stage)
Prompt-based sketch generator via OpenAI DALL·E (once API key is active)

Input: lot size, zoning type, target units

Output: concept image / sketch

🛠️ These modules will be embedded into your existing Replit project:

/permit-tracker

/partners

/design-generator

Next update will come with the code blocks and UI previews.
I'll also tell you exactly what to paste/update in Replit.

Let me know if you want any extra features in these 3 for MVP.
